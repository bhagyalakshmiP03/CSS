The series originally aired on ITV, beginning with the pilot episode on 1 January 1990[1] and ending with "The Best Bits of Mr. Bean" on 15 December 1995. </p>

    <p>     Based on a character developed by Atkinson while he was studying for his master's degree at the University of Oxford, the series centres on Mr. Bean, described by Atkinson as "a child in a grown man's body", as he solves various problems presented by everyday tasks and often causes disruption in the process.[2] The series has been influenced by physical comedy actors such as Jacques Tati and those from early silent films.</p>
