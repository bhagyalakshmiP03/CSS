    <h1>Position Property</h1>
    <p>The position property in CSS is used to control the positioning of an element within its containing element. It can take the following values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>static</strong>: The default value. Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document. It doesn't allow us to define the top and left values</li>
        <li><strong>relative</strong>: The element is positioned relative to its normal position.</li>
        <li><strong>absolute</strong>: The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (not static).</li>
        <li><strong>fixed</strong>: The element is positioned relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.</li>
        <li><strong>sticky</strong>: The element is treated as relative until it crosses a specified threshold, then it becomes fixed.</li>
    </ul>
