    <h1>overflow</h1>
    <p>Overflow is a CSS property that controls what happens when content overflows its container. It can take values like visible, hidden, scroll, and auto.</p>
    <p>Overflow: visible; - The content is not clipped and will overflow the box.</p>
    <p>Overflow: hidden; - The content is clipped and will not be visible outside the box.</p>
    <p>Overflow: scroll; - The content is clipped, but a scrollbar is added to allow scrolling.</p>
    <p>Overflow: auto; - The content is clipped, and a scrollbar is added only if necessary.</p>
    <p>Overflow: inherit; - The property inherits the value from its parent element.</p>
    <p>Overflow: initial; - The property is set to its default value.</p>
    <p>Overflow: unset; - The property is reset to its natural value.</p>
    <p>Overflow: revert; - The property is reset to the value it would have had if the stylesheet had not changed it.</p>
    
    <h1>float</h1>
    
    <img src="E:\HTML SQL CLASS\CSS CLASS\images\img.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Float is a CSS property that allows elements to be positioned to the left or right of their container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around them.</p>
    <p>Float: left; - The element floats to the left of its container.</p>
    <p>Float: right; - The element floats to the right of its container.</p>
    <p>Float: none; - The element does not float and will be displayed in the normal flow of the document.</p>
